# 🐳 Docker For Django-Starter Files 🐳

## Why django into a docker container ?

### For development or production , there are many reasons you might want to use django into a Docker container, here are few :


- SMOOTH INTEGRATION 😎 : Using docker, you can create your own tailored environment. Very easily, you can then share it, as a common working base, accross your network of friends and collaborators. The behavior of your contained files will remain the same, whichever OS or computer you are operating from, bringing CROSSCOMPATIBILITY to the next level 🌎 

- LIGHT AND FAST : To work with django in a Linux environment, you might have had to Setup a dualboot or a VM on your system. This can be time and ressource consumming. Creating an environment through docker, will take at most few minutes and result in a lightweight fast image, sparing your RAM capacity 🐏
